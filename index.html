        <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
			<ol class="main">
				<li class="bullet"><i>What defines success for you in this class?</i>
				<p>I have decided to define success in Web Design I based on three 
				criteria. The first aspect being that I learn more about digital 
				design. Secondly, I hope to gain knowledge on how to apply what I have 
				learned in a real-world setting. Lastly, since this is a college course, 
				success is also decided on whether I pass or fail.</p><br></li>
				
				<li class="bullet"><i>What are your expectations for this class?</i>
				<p>My main expectation for this class is to develop a better understanding
				about digital development. It is important that I learn the fundamentals 
				about designing and developing websites, both in technical aspects, 
				including coding and implementation, and the design aspects, such as 
				formatting, schemes, and more. I expect the class to be engaging, 
				interesting, and resourceful.</p><br></li>
				 
				<li class="bullet"><i>In light of Shrek's wisdom, use 3 words to describe your layers. 
				Provide explanations for each.</i>
				<ul class="bullet">
					<li><b>Responsible: </b>One of my layers includes responsibility. 
					Throughout my school career, I have always taken my learning 
					seriously, which means performing various activities, such as always 
					submitting an assignment on time, never being absent, and receiving 
					steady grades.<br></li>
					
					<li><b>Learner: </b>Another layer that describes myself is being an 
					active learner. While being responsible, I am guided to learn more so 
					I can one day apply myself in my career, and teach others about what 
					I have learned.<br></li>

					<li><b>Organizational: </b>I have consistently had great 
					organizational skills. Making schedules, calendars, to-do lists, and 
					other modes of organization help me sort out my thinking and actions 
					to better achieve my goals and overcome challenges.<br></li>
				</ul>
				<br></li>

				<li class="bullet"><i>What led up to you taking this class? Describe what went into the 
				decision(s).</i>
				<p>I have decided to take this class because I am currently enrolled as a 
				Computer Information Systems student with a specific track of Internet 
				Development. To complete this track, the requirements are to take Web 
				Design I and Web Design II. Internet Development has been an interest to 
				me because throughout schooling I have taken classes related to this 
				course, including Three-Dimensional Animation, Computer Art and Graphic 
				Design, and other digital design oriented classes.</p><br></li>

				<li class="bullet"><i>What do you desire to take away from this class?</i>
				<p>As mentioned briefly above, I desire to take away many knowledgeable 
				aspects of this class with me. I want to know more about the relationship 
				and connections between programming languages, such as HTML and CSS, and 
				the design process. I wish to use these skills to be prepared for a 
				future career in web development.</p><br></li>

				<li class="bullet"><i>What learning did you take away from this week's series of 
				classes?</i>
				<p>Even though we have only met for one session, I have learned a lot in 
				this week's class. We went through the syllabus, which specifically laid 
				out the requirements and expectations of the course for the Spring 
				semester, viewed videos that expanded our background knowledge on the 
				history of the internet, and absorbed the basic protocols of a webpage 
				structure.</p><br></li>

				<li class="bullet"><i>If you were able to travel anywhere, where would you go? Why?</i>
				<p>If I could travel anywhere in the world, I would choose to go to 
				Australia. Primarily, I would like to go snorkeling in the Great Barrier 
				Reef before it dies due to coral bleaching. A trip to explore the 
				Amazon rainforest came in close second behind the Great Barrier Reef. 
				Regardless, if I were to travel anywhere, I would want it to focus on 
				exploring nature rather than civilization and cities because I love the 
				outdoors.</p><br></li>

				<li class="bullet"><i>What else should I know about you?</i>
				<p>You should know that I am committed to try my best in not only this 
				course, but also all my classes, so that I can learn more. I want to work 
				as a web developer after a graduate, so I believe this class will 
				definitely give me an outlook on the general field of digital design.
